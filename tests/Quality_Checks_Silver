Quality Checks
====================================================

Script Purpose:
    This script performs various quality checks for data consistency, accuracy,
    and standardization across the 'silver' schemas. It includes checks for:
    - Null or duplicate primary keys.
    - Unwanted spaces in string fields.
    - Data standardization and consistency.
    - Invalid date ranges and orders.
    - Data consistency between related fields.

Usage Notes:
    - Run these checks after data loading Silver Layer.
    - Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the checks.
Note to Consider:
    - Take into account that this quality check were used when cleaning the data files in the silver layer,
      so you need to replace values inside the quality checks to see if there is bad data inside the columns or not.
